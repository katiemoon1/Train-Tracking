# Train-Tracking
An application using Firebase to track the arrivals and departures of trains.

# NOTE
Please contact me for the API key if you want to see the application in action. I want to demonstrate best security practices by not having an API key in my public repo!

# What does the application do?
The application allows the user to input their favorite trains and keep schedule of the latest departure times. 

# Why is the application useful?
The application demonstrates an understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, DateFns, and Firebase. 

# How can users get started with the application?
The user simply enters in the train information of their choice and once the submit button has been clicked, the train is added to the table at the top. The next departure time and the amount of time before departure are displayed as well. 

# Where can users get help?
Please contact me if there are any questions!

# Who contributes to the project?
I am the sole contributor!
